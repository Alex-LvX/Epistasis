# Epistasis
Calculate and visualize epistasis from combinatorial library

These scripts are meant to be executed according to instructions in our paper: <insert Methods in Enzymology reference>

Use "simplex_regression.py" to assess and calculate epistasis and interactions in a combinatorial dataset.

Use "visualize_epistasis.py" to visualize results from epistasis analysis.
