# Overview  
The 'simplex_regression.py' script analyzes the epistatic effects in a combinatorial mutation dataset using a linear model approach. 

# Requirements  
This example uses version 3 of Python and the following packages:
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* NumPy
* SciKit-learn
* SciPy  
  
To install these packages, simply use the pip-install command. For example:  
```
pip-install matplotlib
```
Alternatively, you can install a version of Python 3 in the form of a package manager like
Anaconda which will usually have all of these dependencies included in the base installation.
